# Excel template Tutorial
MOSAIC is a collaborative database! If you have data (published and unpublished) and would like to contribute, download the Excel template and send it back to mosaic@erdw.ethz.ch. Here we explain how you can fill in the template to contribute your data to MOSAIC.  

## Workbook structure
The workbook has 4 sheets: ARTICLE_AUTHOR, GEOPOINTS_CORE, SAMPLE_ANALYSES, SET_VARIABLES.

The first three sheets refer to the main data categories that the database stores, in a hierarchical configuration: the source metadata is stored in the ARTICLE_AUTHOR sheet, all the information regarding sampling (e.g., coordinates, sampling date, sampling technique) is stored in GEOPOINTS, and the different analyses performed on the sediment samples are stored in SAMPLE_ANALYSES
