# Modern Ocean Sediment Archive and Inventory of Carbon (MOSAIC)

The Modern Ocean Sediment Archive and Inventory of Carbon (MOSAIC) is a database that compiles, but most importantly, harmonizes data from marine sediments worldwide. With this database, we aim to understand the factors that govern the distribution of organic carbon in marine sediments, such as the quantity, origin, and age of organic carbon.

## Contribute to MOSAIC
MOSAIC is a collaborative database! If you have data (published and unpublished) and would like to contribute, download the [Excel template](https://github.com/sarah-paradis/MOSAIC/raw/main/Excel_templates/MOSAIC_input_excel_file_2022.xlsx) and send it back to mosaic@erdw.ethz.ch.

## More to come!
We are currently expanding the database. Stay tuned!
