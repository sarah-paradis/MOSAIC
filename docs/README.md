# Modern Ocean Sediment Archive and Inventory of Carbon (MOSAIC)

The Modern Ocean Sediment Archive and Inventory of Carbon (MOSAIC) is a database that compiles, but most importantly, harmonizes data from marine sediments worldwide. With this database, we aim to understand the factors that govern the distribution of organic carbon in marine sediments, such as the quantity, origin, and age of organic carbon.

## Contribute to MOSAIC
MOSAIC is a collaborative database! If you have data (published and unpublished) and would like to contribute, download the [Excel template](https://github.com/sarah-paradis/MOSAIC/raw/main/Excel_templates/MOSAIC_input_excel_file_2022.xlsx) and send it back to mosaic@erdw.ethz.ch.  
For more information on how to input data into this template, check out this [tutorial](excel_template_tutorial.md) for more information.

## MOSAIC v.2.0
We have been working hard to further expand MOSAIC, and we're ready to launch a new version of the database: **MOSAIC v.2.0!**

### What's new in MOSAIC v.2.0
#### 1. Database structure
We have slightly updated the database's stucture, mainly modified the storage of sample metadata, so you can easily see where the data came from (the reference), how it was measured (method), if we calculated the data based on existing parameters, etc.

#### 2. Database quality check and population workflow

Colors in the tables indicate similarities in the values between each row (Data in MOSAIC vs. Data to be added). **e)** Database query for nearby cores. **f)** Sample analysis table grouping to populate each individual table. **g)** Example of harmonization workflow of radiocarbon analyses and sample composition.</em>

#### 3. More variables



#### 4. Greater spatiotemporal coverage

### How to cite MOSAIC v.2.0.
MOSAIC v.2.0 is currently being peer-reviewed. We will update this section once it is officially published, with its corresponding DOI and other citation metrics.

## More to come!
We just received an Open Research Data-Contribute Project: Application Programming Interface for the Modern Ocean Sedimentary Inventory and Archive of Carbon database (**API-MOSAIC**). With this grant, we will further expand and update the accessibility to the MOSAIC database. 
**New website and API are coming to you this 2023!**
