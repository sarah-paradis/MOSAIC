# Modern Ocean Sediment Archive and Inventory of Carbon (MOSAIC)

The Modern Ocean Sediment Archive and Inventory of Carbon (MOSAIC) is a database that compiles, but most importantly, harmonizes data from marine sediments worldwide. With this database, we aim to understand the factors that govern the distribution of organic carbon in marine sediments, such as the quantity, origin, and age of organic carbon.

## Contribute to MOSAIC
MOSAIC is a collaborative database! If you have data (published and unpublished) and would like to contribute, download the [Excel template](https://github.com/sarah-paradis/MOSAIC/raw/main/Excel_templates/MOSAIC_input_excel_file_2022.xlsx) and send it back to mosaic@erdw.ethz.ch.

## MOSAIC v.2.0

We're expanding MOSAIC, and with

### What's new in MOSAIC v.2.0
#### 1. Database structure
We have slightly updated the database's stucture, mainly modified the storage of sample metadata, so you can easily see where the data came from (the reference), how it was measured (method), if we calculated the data based on existing parameters, etc.

#### 2. Database quality check and population workflow



## More to come!
We just received an Open Research Data-Contribute Project: Application Programming Interface for the Modern Ocean Sedimentary Inventory and Archive of Carbon database (API-MOSAIC). With this grant, we will further expand and update the accessibility to the MOSAIC database. New website and API are coming to you this 2023!
